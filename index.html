## About

This is the official website of the ViResNet project. This project is aimed to devlop deep residual neural networks to detect virus infection.
In our work thus far we developed deep learning approach to identify herpesvirus and adenovirus infected cells in the absence of virus specific markers, and at high accuracy. This was possible based on DNA labeling alone. Upon these results we show that by extending the we can predict the lytic fate of adenovirus infected cells - a poorly understood phenomenon with large pathobiological and therapeutic implications.
Furthermore, our approach provided the ability to identify cells that will undergo lysis up to 20 hours before the occurance.
